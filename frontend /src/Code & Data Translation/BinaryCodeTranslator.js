          <h3>Binary Code Generator</h3>
          <p>
            As one of the most commonly used computing languages in the world,
            binary code has a long and diverse history. When you need to write
            something in a manner that could be understood by a machine, though,
            simply injecting the text is often not enough. Many times, you need
            to convert the message into binary code. Sometimes, this can also
            make a good stylistic change to utterly transform the look and style
            of the text you are working with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you wish to hide your code in a hidden message or you simply
            wish to make a smart design choice, our binary code translator could
            be what you are looking for. Such a tool can be the simplest,
            easiest way for you to change things up and keep the binary code
            available for usage whenever you might happen to need it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge you might have when it comes to binary code is
            learning how to translate ASCII text into binary. This can be a huge
            undertaking, and it could take you several hours just to translate a
            few short paragraphs. Instead of wasting your valuable time like
            this, why not speed up the process and instead use our binary code
            translator?
          </p>
          <p>
            This simple to use translation tool can speed up the entire
            experience. Translation of something as important as binary code is
            very easy to make mistakes with, too, which can lead to all manner
            of problems â€“ least of all changes to the message you intend to put
            across.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to avoid that kind of problem, all you need to do is
            download our translation tool and try it out for yourself. Quickly,
            you will see the immense value that stems from using binary code
            either in coding or in some form of artistic design choice intended.

          <h3>How to change text to binary code?</h3>
          <p>
            All you have to do is write out text on the left hand side and then
            as you do you will see the code being generated on the right. You
            can then copy and paste this code wherever you want. You will see
            that when you paste it back on the right hand side column that it
            also gets converted back into English. You can do this back and
            forth if you wish.
          </p>
